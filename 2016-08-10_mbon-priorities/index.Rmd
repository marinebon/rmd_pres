## Outline

Choose your own adventure...

- Background

- Research

- [Tools](./#sdm)

## Background <!--  -->

- **OBIS-SEAMAP**: marine mammal, seabird, sea turtle geo-portal of observations

- **MGET**: ArcGIS tools for ecological data & analysis (Python, R, Matlab, C++)

- **SDM**: species distribution models for marine mammals in BC, US Atlantic

- **OHI**: 10 goals to describe sustainable ocean benefits to humans

- **SDSS**: spatial decision support systems to sync map, tradeoff plot and table for _siting_ offshore wind and _routing_ around whale strike risk <!-- TODO: embed iframes of apps -->

## Research {.smaller}

 <!-- questions (can we do this?) -->

How can we translate these into operational MBON products? 

- **What proportion of species range is covered by observations?**

    Can we describe the gaps, "darkspots", in observations (OBIS) compared to the expert-derived species ranges (IUCN), to inform strategic future monitoring, particularly for species with high extinction risk?

- **What is the status of structure-forming habitats along coast?**

    Can we estimate the condition & extent of coastal habitats annually & globally using RS, particularly Google Earth Engine and deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks?
    
    <!-- OHI: habitats, coastal protection, carbon storage -->
    
- **Can we describe place-based ecosystem health/resilience based on measures of species abundance and known food webs**?

    EcoSim style food webs.

## Tools

- What is BON in a Box?

  - [video, website]
  
  - SOP (FC) vs tools vs portal kit vs communication system (forum, data sharing)

- Github project management across MBONs: <http://github.com/marinebon>

- "Geo-enrichment" web services <!-- any spatial input, attributes output -->

    - complement to existing APIs (OBIS), THREDDS/ERDDAP servers
    
    - client functions in packages (R, Python, Matlab, ArcGIS)
    
    - connects from simple web portal
    
- Packages (bundles of functions)
  
    - software: R, Python, Matlab, ArcGIS
    
    - plots (time-series), maps (with backgrounds, hexagons), venn diagrams, ordination (eDNA, seascapes) <!-- more detail here from Monterey notes -->
    
    - clients to access data repo APIs: robis, rerddap (see ROpenSci for more: dryad, figshare, DataOne)
    
        - page of datasets by endpoint & client (generated from directory of JSON files, or csv table to describe)
    
    - vignettes with use case scenarios / examples
    
    - unit tests
    
- Manual

    - SOP
    
    - more like BON in box
    
    - communally edited via Github (even w/ just browser)

- Portal Kit

    - data -> summary, tables, plots, maps -> interactive app
    
    - continuous integration

- Dynamic Reports
  
    - dynamic documents using Rmarkdown
    
    - quick: closes gap from data ingestion, analysis, visualization and sharing (no bottlenecks)

- Training Workshops

    - When? 1) August in Monterey?, 2) all hands annual mtg Jan/Feb 2017

    - reproducible research: versioning code & communicating via issues on Github
    
    - dynamic reports (Rmarkdown)
    
    - GUIs for desktop & web (shiny)
    
    - functions in packages

## Dynamic Documents {.smaller}

- live connection to data
- [**Rmarkdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/): R + markdown -> html, docx, pdf

    `r img(src='img/RMarkdownOutputFormats.png', width=300)`

- [rmarkdown-example](https://github.com/bbest/rmarkdown-example): plus references with Zotero

    
<div class="notes">
many formats:
- **pdf**: pretty, professional, portable
- **docx**: use track changes with collaborators
- **html**: web

# Background: OHI

Ocean Health Index

## pie

## Biodiversity in OHI

Species index based on conservation, extinction risk


## Biodiversity: Habitats
Existence values people hold for biodiversity measured through the status of key habitats

$$
x_{HAB} =  \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{C_{c,k}}{C_{r,k}} * \frac{A_{c,k}}{A_{T}}
$$

- $C$ = condition of habitat k, current [$c$] or reference[$r$]

- $A$ = area of habitat k, current [$c$] or total of all habitats [T]

habitats: seagrass beds, salt marshes, subtidal soft-bottom habitats, mangroves, coral reefs, sea ice edge


## Biodiversity: Species
Existence values people hold for biodiversity measured through the status of native species

$$
x_{SPP} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{M} (\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}}{N}) * A_{C}}{A_{T}} 
$$

- $M$ = number of grid cells in the assessment region

- $N$ = number species in a grid cell $c$

- $A$ = total area of a grid cell [$c$] the assessment region [T]

- $w_{i}$ = status weight assigned per threat 

assessed species list and maps: IUCN

<!-- TODO: image of range map over grid extracted -->

# Research Ideas

## What is extent of observations within range of species?

Data:

- ranges: IUCN, AquaMaps

- 

## For coastal haabitats, what is extent and condition over time, globally?

**Problem**: The status and trend of condition and extent for structure-forming habitats are very poorly understand over time on a global scale.

  - coral reef
  
  - mangroves
  
  - seagrass
  
  - salt marsh

**Solution**: Apply cloud computing (Google Earth Engine) and machine learning (convolutional neural networks) to massive online repositories of satellite data to predict annual summaries of habitat extent.

- **Train** classification model: habitat ~ imagery

    - habitat: UNEP-WCMC
    
    - imagery: Google Earth Engine

- **Predict** annually and into the future
