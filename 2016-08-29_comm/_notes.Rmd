## Issues

- Need clarity on what these products?
     - .
   - For Monday, BB TODO: 
     - show MBON analysis [**obis_biodiv**](https://marinebon.github.io/analysis/obis_biodiv.html) in 3 modes
     - silhouette image map
   - Could learn a lot from existing NOAA climate folks and products

- **CAVEATS** Think of trawl catch vs full stock assessment of a fishery!  Raw vs modeled data
   - so maybe pull from white papers on stock assessments, with another time series of more up to date raw data
   - eg for spatial catalogues of marine mammals: LMRIS stock assessments vs OBIS-SEAMAP raw survey observations
   - need to manage expectations! would be good to survey fisheries scientists on utility of MBON, etc; so perhaps RS products correlated

#### Technical Products

- Technical help to be housed at [marinebon.github.io/**help**](https://marinebon.github.io/help/)
- Example MBON [**obis_biodiv**](https://marinebon.github.io/analysis/obis_biodiv.html)
  - arbitrary: 
     - input biological data sources (OBIS, ERDDAP...). pick taxa (which relate to various issues)
     - spatial units of interest (hexagons, grid cells, sanctuary polygons, country EEZs,...)
     - diversity measures (Shannon's, ...). spatial extent, abundance, change over time.
- Other examples
   - OBIS: [Streamlining and enriching the analysis of OBIS data using R](http://iobis.org/2016/05/25/streamlining-analysis/)
    ![obis analysis tools](http://iobis.org/images/analysis.png)
    - aside: [iobis/obis-issues](https://github.com/iobis/obis-issues/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue) to organize tasks
  - [species distribution modeling workflow with `zoon` package](http://rawgit.com/zoonproject/zoon/master/inst/doc/basic-zoon-usage.html)

### Issues

- species categorized by ecological relevance per generalized forms of specific ecological examples in [Potential Management Questions for the portal_Hepner.docx](https://github.com/marinebon/private/files/440032/Potential.Management.Questions.for.the.portal_Hepner.docx):
   - commercial interest
   - conservation status
   - invasive species
   - trophic impacts

#### Client Products

- Sanctuaries Condition Report

- FL Apps
  - eg dashboard

### Social Media

- Twitter (internal): technical / professional
  - research publications
  - technical
- Instagram (public): multimedia 
  - public: videos of transects, sediment sampling, satellite launches,...
- Facebook (internal + public): individual scientists doing work
  - linking above w/ people tagged

### Meetings
- collect wish list
- standardize priorities
- relates to sanctuary mtg Sep 12
- survey monkey, reasons for website input around issues of interest
  - gauge customer readiness and identify skills tier
  - show working examples

### Web Content Aspects

Separate roles per aspect:

1. **Content**: CJ, Ben... using Github
1. **Style**: Aruga (+ Venezuala) HTML/CSS style experts
   - look similar to NOAA / IOOS page for replication, or recommend new look more like NOAA Climate.gov / DigitalCoast / etc
1. **App**: interactive applications, IOOS mapper, Shiny apps

Different Websites:

- **marinebon.org**
  - purpose: general data awareness tool, so if you make own MBON here's how it works for you
    - help us test this out
    - here's the environmental data available (sst, salinity) and relate to biodiversity
  - audience: gov't agencies & scientists, not so much public
  - more how-to's on eDNA, machine learning of imagery, biodiv analysis, ...

  - other example websites with this audience?
    - [NOAA Climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/): science & information for a climate-smart nation
      - climate dashboard

    - [NOAA Digital Coast](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/). nice style
      - data
      - tools
      - training

- **mbon.ioos.org** w/ Gabrielle
  - purpose: here's how to explore final products
  - TODO [BB]: video w/ narration at 2x
  - familiarize users w/ portal, like w/ portal, help site, etc

- NOAA Coastal Risk program - Digital Coast: series of mappers for sea level rise for practitioners teaching
  - urban planners. partnered with American Planning Association (APA). user audience. 
  - 2 phase approach
    - 1) send info links/presentation
    - 2) webinar to address specific community needs
  - [EBM Tools Webinar](http://ebmtools.org)
